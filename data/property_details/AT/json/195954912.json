    "description": "If you're looking for a home that feels like the one—this is it. Nestled at the end of a quiet dead-end street on a rare flat .40-acre lot, this new construction craftsman checks every box (and then builds a few more). From the moment you walk up to the welcoming front porch, you’ll know this isn’t your average home. Soaring 10-ft ceilings, 8-ft doors, and a 15-ft ceiling in the 2-car garage give you the volume, light, and space that make life feel just a little bit more elevated. Enjoy an open-concept main floor perfect for entertaining, featuring quartz countertops, soft-close kitchen cabinetry, and ample natural light. The oversized primary suite includes a luxurious soaking tub, dual vanities, and separate his-and-hers walk-in closets. Upstairs includes a versatile loft-style landing with access to a private deck shared by the hallway and a guest suite. Outdoor living is maximized with three separate decks: a covered front porch for sipping your morning coffee, a rear deck off the main living space, and an upper-level deck. Large secondary bedrooms offer plenty of room for guests or home offices. Located just minutes from Beltline access at Chosewood Park, the vibrant Lee + White food and brewery district, and downtown Atlanta. Quick access to I-75/85, I-20, and I-285. This home is the perfect blend of quiet residential living with close proximity to Atlanta’s most popular amenities.",
