## About this home

Welcome home! This stunning 4 bed, 3.5 bath double corner lot home located in the booming Old Southside has been thoughtfully remodeled down to the studs and is ready for you to call home. Just 5 minutes south of downtown Indianapolis and a quick hop to Garfield Park, you are minutes from everything Indy has to offer. Walk in and you are instantly greeted with a grand staircase, soaring ceilings, and endless natural light. The parquet floors in your front living space mixed with the original extra large pocket door gives you all of the originality of this 1900's home mixed with modern updates. With approximately 3,500 of finished square footage AND a partially finished attic ready for final touches, this home has no shortage of room to spread out. A fully finished basement with both indoor and separate outdoor access, dual laundry units, and a two story deck for skyline views - this gem is one you have to see in person!

Your Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored

## Cookie Settings

The California Consumer Privacy Act 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act 2020 (“CCPA”) permits California residents, or their authorized agents, to opt out of the “sale” and "sharing" of their personal information to third parties. The CCPA defines the terms “sale” and "share" broadly, which may mean they include using third-party advertising and analytics tools such as cookies. We never sell personal information to third parties for money.

When you visit this website, we and our partners may collect certain information about you, your devices, and your behavior, and “sell” or "share" this information to third parties to provide you with certain advertising on this site and across the web tailored to you and your interests. Clicking on the "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" button below will opt you out of the “sale” and "sharing" of your personal information, as defined by the CCPA, of certain advertising of our products and services on this and other sites. If you opt out on this website, your choice will not apply to any other Redfin site, and you will need to separately opt-out on those sites. Similarly, your opt out will only apply to the device on which you opt out, and only for so long as you maintain cookies on the device. Therefore, you must opt out on each device separately (or, if you clear cookies, on the same device) when you visit our website.

If you choose to opt out of the “sale” or "sharing" of your personal information, you may continue to see advertising, such as ads by us or our partners related to you and your interests, including, for example, ads that do not involve the “sale” or "sharing" of personal information. You or your authorized agent may also have other choices and tools that allow you to control certain data collection activities.
