## About this home

Eagle Creek Woods has long-been a best-kept secret in the city, for it is disguised by nature in a way that makes it easy to overlook. With it's canopy of trees, the entire neighborhood feels like an extension of Eagle Creek Park. Indeed, the main Park entrance is just a smidge north, & the marina/boatyard lie only a few blocks south, while the hustle of the city feels miles away. Nestled in the shade of this enchanting community is a NEW OPPORTUNITY for the most discriminating of house hunters. Let us start w/ the grounds, for the lushness of it all may look daunting, but the whole of it are simply mature, low-maintenance gardens that even the most novice gardener can watch thrive. The walks & patios woven through evoke a sense of respite, which is priceless in your own backyard. And you will have time to enjoy this environment, because you need not waste money/time renovating this classic contemporary home, because IT HAS ALL BEEN DONE! In the past few years, nearly every square foot has been carefully updated in an aesthetic that harmonizes with this natural environment. The list is expensively long, let's just say you won't be buying a new roof or HVAC for a long time. Even the driveway has been freshly black-topped, so that the approach to the house is just as lovely as the drive to it. And all of the investment was worth it, for this home was built architecturally interesting, w/ cathedral & vaulted ceilings, abundant windows, a floor-to-ceiling fireplace, decorative balusters at the upper loft/walkway, even a fun wet-bar in the family room that adjoins the stately great room (the floorplan is just perfect for gracious entertaining!) The main floor owners suite continues the soothing, easy-living theme, and lucky be the occupant who claims the bedroom suite with the bonus room upstairs, for it's almost a small apartment! That bonus room would also make a great home gym/office/etc for whatever else you can imagine. This one is truly a MUST SEE!

Your Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored

## Cookie Settings

The California Consumer Privacy Act 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act 2020 (“CCPA”) permits California residents, or their authorized agents, to opt out of the “sale” and "sharing" of their personal information to third parties. The CCPA defines the terms “sale” and "share" broadly, which may mean they include using third-party advertising and analytics tools such as cookies. We never sell personal information to third parties for money.

When you visit this website, we and our partners may collect certain information about you, your devices, and your behavior, and “sell” or "share" this information to third parties to provide you with certain advertising on this site and across the web tailored to you and your interests. Clicking on the "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" button below will opt you out of the “sale” and "sharing" of your personal information, as defined by the CCPA, of certain advertising of our products and services on this and other sites. If you opt out on this website, your choice will not apply to any other Redfin site, and you will need to separately opt-out on those sites. Similarly, your opt out will only apply to the device on which you opt out, and only for so long as you maintain cookies on the device. Therefore, you must opt out on each device separately (or, if you clear cookies, on the same device) when you visit our website.

If you choose to opt out of the “sale” or "sharing" of your personal information, you may continue to see advertising, such as ads by us or our partners related to you and your interests, including, for example, ads that do not involve the “sale” or "sharing" of personal information. You or your authorized agent may also have other choices and tools that allow you to control certain data collection activities.
